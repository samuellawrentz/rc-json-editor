# rc-json-editor
A simple react component that handles your JSON editing woes in a wink ðŸ˜‰

## `rc-json-editor` - The What and Why
This is a simple React Component _(and hence the "rc")_ that takes your JSON as input and renders a beautiful UI which allows you to edit the JSON on the go. I searched the web for this component for my specific needs and was not able to find one. And so, I created one.

### Why do you want a json-editor component?
You may think, why waste time on a component, while you can put `content-editable="true"` on a `code` tag and allow your users to edit their JSON themselves. But the catch here is, not everyone knows the syntax of a JSON. This tool could help in that case.

### This is not the "Perfect" component
It is just a start, issues and PRs are welcome if you find this component helping your needs.

## Dependencies
There are no big dependencies per se.
- react
- react-dom

## Things to do
- Provide the full control of the rendering part as a prop
- Provide event callbacks

## The How?
This component purely works on a custom Datatype called `JsonArray` which extends the `Array` class. So you know, it is an array of sorts, with some additional custom components.

This is a in-progress doc, so please visit the `JsonArrayClass.ts` file for the complete implementation.

> Changes are welcome so are feedbacks.
